WHERE ARE THE USE  CASES
    - read the value inside of the input field at the time of the click of a button
    - well we first constantly check for the value inside of the input filed then store that in a state 
    - after that we use a differnt state to check for a button click - to update somehting using this
    - well this is a ass way to do

HOW AND WHAT   
    - you intialte a ref variable 
    - every react element comes with an inbuilt attrbute for the ref
    - we take the ref attribute and connect it with whatever refVariable we want 
    - we will always have  A JS OBJECT
        - this object have one PROPERTY ONLY: .CURRENT
        - inside of this .current value we have all the values/ attributes of the underneath native element 


    TERNARY OPERATION FOR 

    - if i am empety/false elter the other value if that is not the case enter me instead 

REACT IS ALL ABOUT NOT MAUPALTING THE DOM YOURSELF
    
WHEN A REF CHANGES THE COPONENT FUNCTION DOES NOT RE-EXECUTE
    -when you do the same thing with an STATE VARIABLE THE COMPONENT WILL BE REEXECUTED

    CHANGE IN REF - dosen't reexecute the Componenet
    CHANGE IN STATE - does rerender the Component


IF YOU ESTABLISH A VARIABLE - AND THEN RERENDER
    -so if you establish a variable, then you set the value of that variable before the rerender place
    - once the rerender takes place - the value of the variable extablished before the, rerender will be lost

ONCE YOU ESTABLISH A VARIABLE OUTSIDE OF THE FUNCTION WHICH YOU ARE EXPORTING 
    - i.e right after the import 
    - that variables value will be same for all the instances of the componenent 
    -that variable won't be redefined on rerenders or even when you deploy the same componet more than once all of them would have acess to the same variable and also will affect the same variable
    -shared across all the instance


    - UNLIKE like variables when the component is rerenderd the value is iside of the ref is not lost
    - also will be given in both the instances 

    if you have a value that must be managed but isnt really a state i.e you want to trigger a UI update


for me personally there is no benefit of going into a medical college but i am dead eyed headed that way - here is the thing about me i have so much blieve in me that i am going to pull something off that i don't care that far, but that is the thing this blieve has been going on for the past 3 years exactly lol and shit hasen't changed since
