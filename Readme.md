WHERE ARE THE USE  CASES
    - read the value inside of the input field at the time of the click of a button
    - well we first constantly check for the value inside of the input filed then store that in a state 
    - after that we use a differnt state to check for a button click - to update somehting using this
    - well this is a ass way to do

HOW AND WHAT   
    - you intialte a ref variable 
    - every react element comes with an inbuilt attrbute for the ref
    - we take the ref attribute and connect it with whatever refVariable we want 
    - we will always have  A JS OBJECT
        - this object have one PROPERTY ONLY: .CURRENT
        - inside of this .current value we have all the values/ attributes of the underneath native element 


    TERNARY OPERATION FOR 

    - if i am empety/false elter the other value if that is not the case enter me instead 

REACT IS ALL ABOUT NOT MAUPALTING THE DOM YOURSELF
    
WHEN A REF CHANGES THE COPONENT FUNCTION DOES NOT RE-EXECUTE
    -when you do the same thing with an stt
